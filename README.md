# Fingerprint-Integrity-Analysis
Requirements :

1) opencv
To install this you can use the following command : pip install opencv-python

Dataset Used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing

Note : 
Some versions of opencv might not work with certain interpreters. I personally have faced the issue when importing the library in Pycharm Interpreter. In order to solve the issue just downgrade the opencv library to some older versions.
